#### Breadth First Search or BFS for a Graph 

- Graphs are used to represent many real-life applications

- A graph is a data structure that consists of the following two components: 
    - 1. A finite set of vertices also called as nodes. 
    - 2. A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge. The pair is ordered because (u, v) is not the same as (v, u) in case of a directed graph(di-graph). The pair of the form (u, v) indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v. The edges may contain weight/value/cost.
